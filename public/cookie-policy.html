    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 24, 2025</p>
    
    <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Marco Benvenuti ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on the ReviewMaster website and application (collectively, the "Service").</p>
    
    <h2>What Are Cookies</h2>
    
    <p>Cookies are small pieces of text sent to your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Service or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Service more useful to you.</p>
    
    <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
    
    <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are required for the operation of our Service. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytical/performance cookies:</strong> These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Service. This helps us to improve the way our Service works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our Service. This enables us to personalize our content for you and remember your preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Targeting cookies:</strong> These cookies record your visit to our Service, the pages you have visited, and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our Service and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
    
    <p>In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of the Service and deliver advertisements on and through the Service.</p>
    
    <h3>Facebook Pixel</h3>
    
    <p>Our Service uses Facebook Pixel, a web analytics and advertising service provided by Facebook Inc. ("Facebook"). Facebook Pixel uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Service and to track the effectiveness of our Facebook advertisements. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Service will be transmitted to and stored by Facebook on servers in the United States.</p>
    
    <p>Facebook may use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Service, compiling reports on Service activity for us, and providing other services relating to Service activity and internet usage. Facebook may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Facebook's behalf.</p>
    
    <p>Facebook Pixel also allows us to understand and deliver ads and make them more relevant to you. The collected data remains anonymous, meaning that we cannot see the personal data of any individual user.</p>
    
    <h2>Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
    
    <p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website or application. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Service. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Service to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Service from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>
    
    <h2>Cookies We Use</h2>
    
    <p>Below is a detailed list of the cookies we use on our Service:</p>

    <h2>Managing Cookies</h2>
    
    <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to delete cookies or instruct your web browser to delete or refuse cookies, please visit the help pages of your web browser.</p>
